To start the development Parcel server:

```

To build the application into the `dist` folder:

## Developing customization together with DocMarker

The setup for developing a Doc Marker customization together with the Doc Marker library is kind of complicated. Instead of documenting it in multiple places I decided to link the setup used in the RES-Q+ customization, see the [joint development section of its README](https://github.com/Jirka-Mayer/resq-doc-marker?tab=readme-ov-file#joint-development-with-doc-marker).
